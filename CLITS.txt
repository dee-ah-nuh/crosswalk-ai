Problem Description:
When inserting demo rows into the crosswalk_template
table using the /api/crosswalk/demo endpoint, the 
inserted client_id (e.g., "TEST") does not show up in
the client dropdown in the frontend. This is because 
the dropdown is populated from the profiles table, not from
crosswalk_template. Inserting rows into crosswalk_template
does not create a new profile, so the client_id will not 
appear in the dropdown unless a corresponding profile exists.
This is also because the response from the POST into the clients-demo/
is also malformed, we need to insert using JSON format. 

Solution:
To make the client_id (e.g., "TEST") appear in the dropdown, 
you must create a profile for it by sending a POST request to 
the /api/profiles endpoint with the correct payload. This will 
add the client_id to the profiles table, making it available for
selection in the frontend dropdown. Ensure the POST payload 
matches the backend's expected structure (e.g., includes the 
required profile name field).


Status: 
Resolved.

- fetch api for the data model 
- change the columns were bringing in by only using the datamodel column fields
