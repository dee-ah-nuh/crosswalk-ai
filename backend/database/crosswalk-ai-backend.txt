Been working on this for roughly 40 hours. 
Heres whats been done. 

[ backend ]

#########################
-- appy.py 

Created API and backend using FASTAPI -  just the backbone
script which helps & tell developers what functions they should
be importing just like normal Python packages. 

CORS middleware just specifies what specific ports are going to be allowed
to get access to the app, most likely will be handled by security, would 
probably only be accessible through the RDS. 

API Routers just means that whatever route you specify in the TSX pages (the UI that 
is displayed) but handled by the backend file, runs on that specific link or route. 
For example, if the page were trying to get is the actual crosswalk mapping page aka:

APP_LINK.COM/crosswalk/

we would import the crosswal function like a normal python package and then say to the 
router, hey allow crosswalk to be displayed at my link (APP_LINK.COM/crosswalk/). 
Even though this script says api/ -- that will be replaced with the actual link we get --.
todo: we will create a data model page for the datamodel from aarete, and a button at the 
top of every script so we can it at any time in any part of website, and so on for others.

So, initially, this did not contain a model nor did I want it 
to contain a model, I gave the problem statement to ChatGPT and it 
gave me like a file parser for the REGEX and a self-learning model 
that handles that.
